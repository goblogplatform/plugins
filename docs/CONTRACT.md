# Publishing a goblog plugin

The directory at [goblog.live/plugins](https://goblog.live/plugins) lists plugins from this registry. A plugin is a GitHub repository whose releases each carry a compiled WebAssembly module; each GitHub release is a version. Submitting means adding your repository to `registry.yaml` in a pull request — CI validates it and, once merged, the index is rebuilt (on every merge and every six hours).

**Only WebAssembly plugins are accepted.** Yaegi-interpreted `.go` plugins (goblog's [dynamic plugins](https://github.com/goblogplatform/goblog#dynamic-plugins)) still work when an operator drops the file in by hand, but the directory does not list or install them: a `.wasm` module can bundle any dependency its author likes, runs with no filesystem and no network beyond the hosts it declares, and needs no goblog rebuild.

## What the directory publishes

The index entry for your plugin is built from the manifest, the latest release and its `plugin.wasm` asset (`download_url` is the asset's browser URL; `sha256` is of the asset), and your repository's GitHub star count (`stars`), which the directory uses for its default ordering. Stars are best-effort: if GitHub cannot be reached for them, the entry is published with `0`. The entry also carries `runtime: "wasm"`, `install_type: "wasm"` and the manifest's `allowed_hosts`, which goblog's admin page shows as "Talks to: …" before an operator installs.

## What the repository must contain

At the root of the repository, at the release tag being published (the tool checks the latest release):

| File | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `goblog-plugin.json` | yes | the manifest, below |
| the plugin's source | yes | anything that builds the module — Go with [`github.com/extism/go-pdk`](https://github.com/extism/go-pdk), TinyGo, Rust, or any language with an [Extism PDK](https://extism.org/docs/concepts/pdk) |
| `README.md` | yes | shown on the plugin's directory page |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | no | shown when present |
| `LICENSE` | yes | must match `license` in the manifest |

And attached to every release: the compiled module, named as `entry` in the manifest (default `plugin.wasm`). The module is a release **asset**, not a file in the repository.

### `goblog-plugin.json`

```json
{
  "name": "hello",
  "display_name": "Hello",
  "description": "One sentence shown in the listing.",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "license": "Apache-2.0",
  "runtime": "wasm",
  "entry": "plugin.wasm",
  "allowed_hosts": ["api.example.com"],
  "min_goblog_version": "0.2.9",
  "homepage": "https://example.com/optional"
}
```

- `name`: `^[a-z0-9-]+$`, unique across the registry, and equal to the `name` your plugin's `identity` export returns. It keys the plugin's settings and its persistent store, so keep it stable across versions.
- `display_name`: the label shown in the directory. It does not have to equal your plugin's `display_name`, which labels its settings group in the admin UI.
- `license`: an SPDX identifier from the list in `internal/registry/manifest.go` (MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD-2/3-Clause, ISC, MPL-2.0, GPL/LGPL/AGPL `-only`/`-or-later`, Unlicense, 0BSD). Open an issue to add another.
- `runtime`: must be `"wasm"`. Anything else is rejected.
- `entry`: the name of the `.wasm` asset attached to each release (letters, digits, `_`, `.`, `-`; no path); defaults to `plugin.wasm`.
- `allowed_hosts`: the hosts the module may reach over HTTP — exact hostnames (`api.example.com`), IPs, or globs (`*.example.com`), each optionally with a port; never a scheme or a path. A glob must still name a domain — `*` alone (or `**`, `*.*`) is rejected. Omit it, or leave it empty, and the plugin gets no network at all. goblog checks every request (and every redirect hop) against this list, and the directory shows it to operators as "Talks to" before they install, so declare only what you use.
- `min_goblog_version`: plain semver (`0.2.9`, no `v`) — the oldest goblog your plugin works with. WebAssembly plugins need at least `0.2.9`.

### The module

A plugin is one `.wasm` file built for [Extism](https://extism.org/): every export takes and returns JSON through Extism's input/output. Only `identity` is mandatory; the others (`settings`, `pages`, `jobs`, `template_head`, `template_footer`, `template_data`, `render_page`, `run_job`, `on_init`) are optional and mirror goblog's compiled-in plugin interface. Host functions give you a per-plugin key/value store (`store_get`/`store_set`/`store_delete`/`store_list`), logging through the PDK's logger, and Extism's `http_request` limited to `allowed_hosts`. Calls are capped at 10 s (120 s for jobs and `on_init`) and 64 MB of memory. The full contract — every export's input and output shape, `ctx`, the host functions and the limits — is in goblog's README under [WebAssembly plugins](https://github.com/goblogplatform/goblog#webassembly-plugins), and [`plugin/wasm/testdata/echo/main.go`](https://github.com/goblogplatform/goblog/blob/main/plugin/wasm/testdata/echo/main.go) implements all of it. [goblog-plugin-hello](https://github.com/goblogplatform/goblog-plugin-hello) is the smallest complete example and is meant to be copied.

With the standard Go toolchain (1.24 or newer):

```bash
GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm go build -buildmode=c-shared -ldflags="-s -w" -o plugin.wasm .
```

The module must be 16 MiB or smaller; `-ldflags="-s -w"` keeps a Go build well under that.

### Releases

- Tag releases `vX.Y.Z` (exactly three numbers). Drafts and pre-releases are ignored.
- The tag without `v` must equal the `version` your plugin's `identity` export returns.
- **Every release must have the module attached** as the asset named by `entry`. The registry validates and publishes the asset, never a file from the repository, so a release without it fails validation with `has no asset named plugin.wasm`.
- The GitHub release body is shown as the version's release notes.
- The directory lists the **latest** published release; the detail page shows all of them.

Copy this workflow into `.github/workflows/release.yml` and the asset is built and uploaded whenever you publish a release:

```yaml
name: Release
on:
  release:
    types: [published]
permissions:
  contents: write
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v7
      - uses: actions/setup-go@v7
        with:
          go-version-file: go.mod
      - name: Build plugin.wasm
        run: GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm go build -buildmode=c-shared -ldflags="-s -w" -o plugin.wasm .
      - name: Upload to the release
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
        run: gh release upload "${{ github.event.release.tag_name }}" plugin.wasm --clobber
```

The registry reads the asset when it validates; if the workflow is still uploading when it looks, re-run validation once the asset is up (edit your submission issue, or re-run the pull request's checks).

## Check before you submit

```bash
GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm go build -buildmode=c-shared -ldflags="-s -w" -o plugin.wasm .
docker run --rm --network none -v "$PWD:/p:ro" \
  --entrypoint /go/src/github.com/compscidr/goblog/goblog compscidr/goblog:v0.2.9 \
  validate-plugin /p/plugin.wasm
# {"name":"hello","display_name":"Hello","version":"1.0.0","runtime":"wasm"}
```

The registry's CI runs this (plus a timeout and memory/process limits) against the asset on your latest release, then requires `"runtime":"wasm"` and compares `name` and `version` with your manifest and tag. `validate-plugin` loads the module with no store and no network and calls `identity`, `settings`, `pages` and `jobs`, so those exports must not depend on either.

## Submit

1. Open a [submission issue](https://github.com/goblogplatform/plugins/issues/new?template=submit-plugin.yml) with your `owner/name` (the box on goblog.live/plugins does this for you).
2. The `Submission` workflow validates the repository and comments the result; if it passes it opens the `registry.yaml` pull request (this requires the repository secret `SUBMIT_TOKEN` to be set — see the main [README](../README.md#submissions); without it, the workflow still comments the validation result but a maintainer must open the pull request by hand).
3. A maintainer merges it; the index rebuilds within minutes.

Alternatively, open a pull request by hand: fork this repository, add a line to `registry.yaml`, and open a PR — the `validate` workflow must pass.
```yaml
plugins:
  - repo: goblogplatform/goblog-plugin-hello
  - repo: you/goblog-plugin-yours
```

Plugins run inside the goblog process of whoever installs them, sandboxed but trusted with the hosts they declare and the settings they are given. Keep them small and readable; the registry is curated and maintainers may decline or remove entries.
